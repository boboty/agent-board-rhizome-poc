# MCP tool catalog

## 1. Protocol conventions

MCP messages use JSON-RPC 2.0.

Tool inputs and outputs are JSON objects validated by JSON Schema.

Tools return:

- `structuredContent` as the authoritative result;
- an optional short text summary;
- short `next_actions` on workflow-sensitive results;
- no full duplication of large JSON results in text.

The initialize response contains compact baseline workflow instructions. Full
guidance is available through these static Markdown resources:

- `rhizome://guides/agent-workflow`;
- `rhizome://guides/issue-lifecycle`;
- `rhizome://guides/multi-agent-handoff`.

All IDs accepted as `issue_id` may be either:

- internal ULID;
- display ID such as `ISSUE-42`.

Other entity IDs use internal ULIDs only.

## 2. Common response conventions

Potentially large results include:

```text
has_more
next_cursor
truncated
truncation_reason
```

Collections use cursor-based pagination.

Default collection limit: `20`.

Maximum ordinary collection limit: `100`.

Errors use:

```json
{
  "code": "VERSION_CONFLICT",
  "message": "Issue version precondition failed.",
  "details": [],
  "retryable": false
}
```

### 2.1. Explicit agent-session attribution

Durable attribution is opt-in and transport-neutral. It never derives from an
SDK `ServerSession`, `Mcp-Session-Id`, HTTP connection, or `initialize` request.
All tool input schemas except `open_project`, `create_agent_session` and
`end_agent_session` include this optional property:

```json
{
  "agent_session_handle": null
}
```

When present, `agent_session_handle` is a non-empty opaque bearer string with a
maximum of 256 ASCII characters. It is not an entity ID, is returned only by
`create_agent_session`, and must not appear in tool output, events, errors, or
logs. Supplying `null` is equivalent to omitting it.

The adapter resolves a supplied handle through the application service before a
mutating operation opens its business transaction. It passes the resolved
durable `session_id` to the existing domain command; domain and SQLite layers
continue to store only that nullable ULID in attempts and audit records. A
read-only tool may validate a supplied handle but never updates
`last_seen_at`. A mutating tool validates the active session and advances
`last_seen_at` in its own transaction *before* the business transaction opens,
not atomically with it: `last_seen_at` is not rolled back if the subsequent
business mutation fails (e.g. `VERSION_CONFLICT`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`), and a
session that ends in the (sub-millisecond) gap between the touch and the
mutation is still attributed for that one call. This is a deliberate,
documented best-effort scope, not a bug: making the touch and the mutation
transactionally atomic requires a unit of work spanning arbitrary repository
transactions, which does not exist yet.

Handle errors are stable, non-retryable structured errors:

| Condition | Error code | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| malformed or overlong handle | `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | `field: agent_session_handle`, `code: INVALID_HANDLE` |
| well-formed but unknown handle | `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` | `field: agent_session_handle`, `code: NOT_FOUND` |
| ended handle | `SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE` | `field: agent_session_handle`, `code: ENDED` |

Clients that omit the property remain fully functional and their resulting
attempts, entities, and events have NULL session attribution. A handle provides
audit attribution only; it neither authenticates the caller nor replaces an
attempt's `lease_token`.

### 2.2. Stateless project routing

`open_project` is the only projectless tool. Call it with an absolute
`project_root`, retain the returned canonical `project_ref`, and pass that value
to every subsequent project-scoped tool call. Calling `open_project` does not
select a project in MCP transport or session state.

Every other tool input schema includes an optional nullable `project_ref`.
Omission is supported only when the server was started with a configured default
project. Portable agent workflows pass the reference explicitly, including on
`get_project`, attempt lifecycle calls, and `finish_attempt`. A `project_ref` is
a routing token, not authentication or authorization.

For readability, later input snippets focus on tool-specific fields. Unless the
snippet is for `open_project`, add the retained value:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV"
}
```

## 3. Response budgets and client guidance

The default MCP responses in this catalog are intentionally bounded projections. The acceptance gate in the integration suite serializes the actual `structuredContent` payload and asserts the byte budgets below so clients can rely on the defaults staying compact even when issue bodies and other free-text fields are very large.

The following defaults are covered by the integration gate and should be treated as the documented baselines for normal client use:

| Tool | Default fields or delivery | Budget |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `get_issue` | standard: `id`, `display_id`, `sequence_no`, `type`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `ready_rank`, `parent_issue_id`, `blocked_reason`, `version`, timestamps, `labels`; no bodies | 32 KiB |
| `get_issue_graph` | `root_issue_id`, bounded `nodes`, `edges`, `summary`, `entry_points`, truncation fields | 32 KiB for the deterministic fixture used in the integration test |
| `get_planning_graph` | bounded `nodes`, `edges`, `entry_points`, `blocking_nodes`, `summary`, `warnings`, `truncated` | 32 KiB for the deterministic fixture used in the integration test |
| `manage_issue_relation` | `changed`, relation fields, `affected_issues` | 32 KiB |
| `create_issue` | compact: `id`, `display_id`, `sequence_no`, `type`, `status`, `priority`, `version` | 32 KiB |
| `update_issue` | compact `issue` (`id`, `display_id`, `status`, `version`) and `changed_fields` | 32 KiB |
| `archive_issue` | compact: `id`, `display_id`, `status`, `version` | 32 KiB |
| `unarchive_issue` | compact: `id`, `display_id`, `status`, `version` | 32 KiB |
| `claim_issue` | compact `issue`, compact `attempt`, `lease_token` | 32 KiB |
| `renew_attempt` | `lease_expires_at`, `server_time`, `next_actions` | 32 KiB |
| `save_attempt_note` | `attempt_note`, `artifacts`, `next_actions` | 64 KiB |
| `finish_attempt` | compact `attempt`, compact `issue`, `warnings`, `latest_event_id`, compact `artifacts`, `next_actions` | 128 KiB |
| `get_work_context` | `issue`, `blockers`, `decisions`, `reviews`, attempt/checkpoint summaries, optional-section placeholders, warnings and truncation fields | 256 KiB |
| `get_issue_activity` | `items`, `next_cursor`, `has_more` | 32 KiB |
| `get_changes` | `events`, `latest_event_id`, `has_more`, `next_event_id` | 128 KiB |
| `validate_issue_plan` | `valid`, `errors`, `warnings`, `plan_fingerprint`, `normalization_changed`; no `normalized_plan` | 32 KiB |
| `export_project` | artifact: `format`, `version`, `exported_at`, `byte_count`, `sha256`, `artifact_uri` | 32 KiB |

Existing list/graph budgets remain authoritative for the larger maximum-node cases: `list_issues` stays within 64 KiB for 100 compact items, and graph results stay within 96 KiB for 100-node graphs. Those are maximum-node proofs and should not be treated as the default response size for ordinary calls.

Explicit opt-in modes are intentionally larger and are not part of the default gate:

- `get_issue` with `view: "full"` includes the full free-text bodies and full label metadata; it is larger than the standard default when bodies are present.
- `validate_issue_plan` with `include_normalized_plan: true` includes the normalized plan and is larger than the compact default.
- `export_project` with `delivery: "inline"` returns the full logical project document and is not used in the default budget gate; it can exceed the bounded artifact acknowledgement and is only appropriate when the caller needs the document itself.
- Optional sections in `get_work_context` are opt-in and bounded by their own per-section limits; the default response intentionally includes the primary issue's full description and acceptance criteria, which is why its budget is larger than the other compact defaults.

Client guidance:

- Call `open_project` once to get a canonical `project_ref`, then reuse that reference for subsequent project-scoped calls.
- Use `get_project` only for metadata or instruction refresh; avoid treating it as a full state snapshot or a substitute for targeted reads.
- Filter and list first (`list_issues`, `get_planning_graph`, `get_issue_graph`) before requesting detail calls for specific issues.
- Request explicit `full`, normalized-plan, or `inline` modes only when the caller genuinely needs the larger payload; the default responses are designed to stay compact and predictable.

Audited baselines from prior review work are informative but are not current default-response guarantees: a 20-node planning graph was observed at approximately 26 KiB, and a pre-ISSUE-154 inline export was observed at approximately 981 KiB.

**Catalog budget.** The advertised tool catalog is itself a bounded payload: a client sends the entire `tools/list` result to its model before any work happens, so the catalog is part of every agent session's fixed token cost and gets the same budget-plus-test treatment as response payloads. Two mechanisms keep it compact without losing anything an agent uses:

- **Advertised output schemas are compact projections of the strict schemas.** Field names, types, nullability, enums, and descriptions are advertised in full; per-object `required` arrays (which re-list every property name) and `additionalProperties` markers — validator strictness, not caller information — are stripped, `oneOf` unions are advertised as `anyOf`, and two intentionally shallow branches replace bulky legacy payloads: the `view: "full"` response shapes of `create_issue`, `update_issue`, `archive_issue`, `claim_issue`, and `finish_attempt` (their compact defaults stay fully specified) and `export_project`'s inline logical document (specified in [docs/07](07-logical-interchange.md)). The strict originals remain the validation contract: the output-conformance suite (`TestOutputSchemaConformance` and its companions in `internal/adapters/mcp/output_conformance_test.go`) validates every real response against the strict schema, so trimming the advertisement never weakens what CI proves about actual outputs. Input schemas are advertised unmodified — their `required` lists and closed-property sets are caller-facing contract.
- **Enforced budgets.** The full-profile catalog stays within **112 KiB** total and **16 KiB** per tool, asserted by `TestToolCatalogStaysWithinByteBudget`; `TestAdvertisedOutputSchemasAreCompactProjections` (both in `internal/adapters/mcp/catalog_budget_test.go`) structurally guarantees the projection is applied to every advertised output schema. Measured after this compaction: approximately 96 KiB across 43 tools, down from approximately 129 KiB before it.

### 3.1. `create_agent_session`

Creates a durable attribution session independently of MCP transport lifecycle.

Input:

```json
{
  "client_name": "GitHub Copilot",
  "client_version": "1.2.3",
  "agent_label": null,
  "model": null,
  "instance_key": null,
  "worktree": null
}
```

`client_name` is required and the remaining metadata fields are optional,
non-blank strings of at most 256 runes, except `worktree`, which allows up to
1024 runes because an absolute worktree path is routinely longer. `worktree`
records the checked-out worktree this session is running in; like
`instance_key` it is descriptive metadata, never an ownership or security
input. The tool is mutating,
non-idempotent, and returns `session` metadata plus
`agent_session_handle`. The handle is shown only in this response and must be
retained by the client; it cannot be recovered later.

### 3.2. `end_agent_session`

Ends one explicitly created session.

Input:

```json
{
  "agent_session_handle": "opaque bearer handle"
}
```

The tool validates the handle and sets `ended_at` and `last_seen_at` in one
short write transaction. Repeating it with the same still-recognized handle is
successful and returns the original ended session unchanged; it does not update
timestamps. Unknown and malformed handles use the errors in section 2.1.
Ending a session does not terminate active attempts or invalidate their lease
tokens; later attempt operations can omit attribution or use another active
handle.

### 3.3. Required implementation boundary

The implementation of this contract is bounded as follows:

- **Domain:** retain `AgentSession.ID` as the internal ULID, add only
  handle-resolution inputs and stable handle validation details; preserve the
  nullable `session_id` fields on existing mutation commands.
- **Application:** generate a cryptographically random handle, hash it before
  persistence, create, resolve, touch, and end sessions through one service;
  resolve-and-touch for a mutating call runs in its own transaction before the
  business mutation, on a best-effort basis (see section 2.1) rather than
  atomically with it.
- **MCP adapter:** add the two lifecycle tools and the optional common input
  property to every existing tool schema; resolve the property before passing
  command inputs. Remove `InitializedHandler`, `ServerSession.ID()`,
  `Mcp-Session-Id`, `connectionSessions`, `sdkSessionIDs`, and HTTP/stdio close
  lifecycle attribution.
- **SQLite:** migrate `agent_sessions` with a non-null unique `handle_hash`,
  use indexed hash lookup, and provide active-handle resolution plus touch as
  its own committed transaction, run before the mutation's transaction rather
  than inside it. Existing nullable attribution foreign keys and historical
  rows remain unchanged.
- **Tests:** cover creation, single-return handle redaction, omitted handles,
  malformed/unknown/ended errors, idempotent end, read-only no-touch, a failed
  mutation leaving `last_seen_at` already advanced from its pre-touch (not
  rolled back), concurrent use/end races, reconnect and process-restart
  recovery, and both MCP protocol eras over stdio and HTTP.
- **Documentation:** update examples and operational guidance after the runtime
  implementation lands; do not describe HTTP `DELETE` or SDK session closure as
  durable session termination.

## 4. Tool annotations

Every tool returned by `tools/list` carries an explicit
[MCP tool annotation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) set:
`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`. These are
assigned in code through one required `toolHints(...)` argument on every
registration call in `internal/adapters/mcp/adapter.go`, so a newly added tool
that omits this argument fails to compile — the classification cannot be
silently skipped.

**Annotations are advisory client guidance, not an authorization boundary.**
A client may use them to decide whether to warn a user or skip a confirmation
prompt, but the server always re-validates every request server-side
regardless of what a client inferred from these hints. Nothing here weakens
or replaces domain-level validation, optimistic concurrency, or lease checks.

**`readOnlyHint: true` means the invocation performs no durable write at
all, including transport-level bookkeeping.** Every tool call also carries
MCP session lifecycle tracking (`agent_sessions.last_seen_at`), which is
itself a durable SQLite write. Rather than special-case that write per
tool, `internal/adapters/mcp/adapter.go`'s registration wrapper
(`touchSessionForMutatingTool`) derives the decision from the same
`readOnlyHint` used everywhere else in this section: a tool registered as
read-only never touches `last_seen_at` as a side effect of being called; a
mutating tool still touches it on every call, so session activity tracking
stays correlated with actual writes rather than with every call including
reads. This is enforced structurally for every tool, not only for `get_project` —
see `TestReadOnlyToolsDoNotDurablyTouchAgentSession` in the adapter test
suite and its stdio/HTTP counterparts,
`TestIntegrationStdioReadOnlyToolsDoNotTouchAgentSession` and
`TestIntegrationHTTPReadOnlyToolsDoNotTouchAgentSession`, in `integration/`.

`openWorldHint` is `false` for every tool: Rhizome only reads and writes its
own local SQLite project database. No tool fetches a URL or otherwise reaches
into an external system on the server's behalf (artifact `uri` values are
stored as opaque strings, never dereferenced).

`idempotentHint` is `true` only where repeating the exact same call arguments
is *guaranteed* to produce no additional effect beyond the first call — not
merely because a tool happens to accept an optional `idempotency_key`. Two
independent patterns earn a `true` here:

- **Mandatory-key replay** — `apply_issue_plan` and `replace_review_request`
  require `idempotency_key` on every call (it is a required schema field,
  not optional) and the repository replays the original result for a
  repeated key. Same arguments necessarily means the same key, so the
  guarantee holds unconditionally.
- **Fail-safe-on-retry gating** — a mutation guarded by a precondition that
  the first successful call itself invalidates: optimistic-concurrency
  `expected_version` (`update_issue`, `archive_issue`,
  `cancel_review_request`, `replace_review_request`'s predecessor), a
  claimability check (`claim_issue`), an active-lease check
  (`finish_attempt`, `release_resources`), an ended-state check
  (`end_agent_session`, which replays the already-ended session unchanged),
  an upsert key (`submit_gate_evidence`, keyed by attempt and requirement
  key), or a storage constraint (`manage_issue_relation`'s unique
  `(source, target, type)` index on add, not-found on remove;
  `apply_import`'s empty-destination requirement). After the first call, the
  precondition no longer holds, so a bare repeat with identical arguments
  fails without any further write — analogous to the MCP specification's own
  `delete_file` example. `replace_review_request` satisfies both patterns at
  once: the mandatory key gives replay, and the predecessor's
  `expected_version` additionally fails safe if a caller races without
  noticing the key collision.

Tools that only ever append or insert with no such gate and no mandatory key
(`create_agent_session`, `create_issue`, `add_comment`, `record_decision`,
`save_attempt_note`, `renew_attempt`, `reserve_resources`, and
`manage_workflow_policy`, whose `create` action makes a new policy each
call) are `idempotentHint: false`: a bare repeat creates a second session,
issue, comment, decision, note, policy, or reservation set, or (for
`renew_attempt`) pushes the lease expiry further out again. An optional
`idempotency_key` on these tools changes behavior only when the caller
actually supplies one — it is not part of the unconditional invocation
contract, so it does not change the hint.

`create_review_request` is `idempotentHint: false` for a narrower reason: it
does have a gate — a repeat whose content matches the target's still-live
`open` or `claimed` request replays that request instead of opening a second
one — but the gate is that live request, and `cancel_review_request` resolves
it without changing the issue. An identical repeat after a cancel therefore
opens a new request rather than replaying or failing. A conditional guarantee
is not the unconditional one this hint asserts.

`destructiveHint` follows the guidance's own examples — overwrite, archive,
cancel, supersede, bulk-apply, or otherwise destroying prior effective state —
rather than the tool's read/write split alone:

- `update_issue` can overwrite title, description, status, and
  `blocked_reason`.
- `archive_issue` and `cancel_review_request` each end the prior lifecycle
  state of their target.
- `manage_issue_relation` can remove an existing relation (`action: "remove"`).
- `apply_import` and `apply_issue_plan` are bulk-apply operations with a wide
  blast radius even though individual writes are additive.
- `finish_attempt` can transition an issue's status (including to `blocked`,
  overwriting a prior `blocked_reason`) as part of ending the lease.
- `record_decision` can flip an existing decision's `status` to `superseded`
  in the same transaction when `supersedes_id` is supplied.
- `replace_review_request` is destructive: a successful call ends the
  predecessor's lifecycle (superseded) as part of creating its successor,
  in the same transaction.
- `release_resources` ends the lifecycle of every reservation it releases;
  released reservations can never be reactivated.
- `manage_workflow_policy` can overwrite a policy's requirements
  (`action: "update"`) or retire it irreversibly (`action: "archive"`).

A blank cell means the hint is `false`. `openWorldHint` is `false` for every
tool, per the local-first rationale above. This matrix is kept from drifting
by two tests: `TestToolAnnotationMatrixMatchesCatalog` asserts the in-code
matrix against the live `tools/list` catalog, and
`TestAnnotationMatrixDocMatchesExpectedHints` parses this table and asserts
it against that same in-code matrix (both in
`internal/adapters/mcp/annotations_test.go` /
`annotations_doc_test.go`) — the same pattern
`TestErrorCodesDocMatchesDomain` applies to section 13.

## 5. Tool exposure profiles

A server instance can advertise a reduced tool catalog by selecting a
**tool profile** at startup — an exposure and prompt-size control for
narrowing what a given deployment shows a client. When no named profile
fits, a **free-form toolset selection** (section 5.4) composes a catalog
directly from the same capability groups instead. Neither is an
authorization boundary: every tool that is advertised still enforces its
own domain-level validation exactly as if every tool were advertised.
Nothing about catalog filtering weakens optimistic concurrency, lease
checks, or any other server-side rule.

### 5.1. Selecting a profile

Configure the profile before starting the server, through either path:

```bash
rhizome-mcp serve --profile agent
rhizome-mcp serve --http-address 127.0.0.1:0 --profile read-only
```

```bash
RHIZOME_TOOL_PROFILE=migration rhizome-mcp serve
```

The `--profile` CLI flag takes precedence over `RHIZOME_TOOL_PROFILE`,
which in turn takes precedence over the deprecated unprefixed
`TOOL_PROFILE` fallback (docs/04 §17.1); using the unprefixed name logs a
stderr deprecation warning. The same precedence applies to
`--http-address` / `RHIZOME_HTTP_ADDRESS` / the deprecated `HTTP_ADDRESS`.
Selecting either the transport or the tool profile from the environment
rather than a flag also prints a separate stderr notice naming what was
selected (docs/08 §"Binding and configuration"), so environment-driven
behavior is never silent. Leaving both unset keeps the default, `full`,
so an unconfigured server is unchanged from every prior release: the
complete existing tool catalog remains backward compatible.

An unrecognized profile name fails server startup immediately, before any
transport opens, with a structured error naming the invalid value and
every valid name:

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
  "message": "unsupported tool profile \"read-write\" (valid profiles: full, agent, read-only, migration)",
  "details": [{"field": "tool_profile", "code": "INVALID_ENUM"}],
  "retryable": false
}
```

`get_project`'s `tool_profile` field always reports the profile actually
in effect (or `custom` when a free-form toolset selection is active,
section 5.4), so a client that expects a tool and doesn't see it in
`tools/list` can immediately tell whether a catalog selection — not a
bug — is the reason.

### 5.2. Profile membership matrix

Every registered tool declares exactly one capability group in
`internal/adapters/mcp/adapter.go` (`registerTool(server, group, ...)`);
this is a required argument, so a newly added tool cannot be registered
without an explicit group decision. `full`, `agent`, and `migration` are
defined as which groups they include. `read-only` is defined differently
and deliberately: `toolProfileIncludes` checks `readOnlyHint` *before* any
group-based rule, including the `core` group's own "always advertised"
bypass — so a hypothetical future mutating core tool could never enter
the read-only profile just by being core. `read-only` membership is
derived directly from each tool's own `readOnlyHint` (section 4.1), not
from a separately maintained list, so it can never drift from the
annotation matrix.

| Group | Tools | In `agent`? | In `migration`? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| core | `open_project`, `get_project` | always | always |
| migration | `export_project`, `validate_import`, `apply_import` | no | yes |
| sync | `get_changes` | no | no |
| issues | `list_labels`, `create_issue`, `update_issue`, `unarchive_issue`, `get_issue`, `list_issues`, `archive_issue`, `manage_issue_relation`, `get_issue_graph`, `get_planning_graph` | yes | no |
| planning | `validate_issue_plan`, `apply_issue_plan` | yes | no |
| review | `create_review_request`, `get_review_request`, `list_review_requests`, `cancel_review_request`, `replace_review_request` | yes | no |
| knowledge | `add_comment`, `record_decision`, `list_decisions`, `get_issue_activity`, `search` | yes | no |
| lifecycle | `claim_issue`, `renew_attempt`, `save_attempt_note`, `finish_attempt`, `get_work_context`, `reserve_resources`, `release_resources`, `list_resource_reservations`, `get_resource_reservation`, `submit_gate_evidence`, `evaluate_gates` | yes | no |
| governance | `manage_workflow_policy`, `get_workflow_policy`, `list_workflow_policies` | no | no |

- **`full`** (default): every group, all 44 tools.
- **`agent`** (37 tools): every group except `migration`, `sync` and
  `governance` — the complete ordinary issue discovery, planning, review,
  knowledge, and leased work lifecycle workflow, without bulk project
  transfer, incremental synchronization, or the ability to rewrite the
  workflow policies that gate its own work. An agent still gets
  `submit_gate_evidence` and `evaluate_gates`, so it can satisfy a gate and
  see why one failed; it simply cannot change what the gates require.
- **`read-only`**: exactly the tools with `readOnlyHint: true` in the
  section 4.1 matrix, spanning every group (including read operations
  inside `migration` and `sync`, e.g. `validate_import`,
  `get_changes` — reading is safe regardless of which group a tool
  otherwise belongs to). No tool this profile advertises can be
  classified as mutating; that invariant is enforced by
  `TestToolProfileReadOnlyContainsOnlyReadOnlyHintedTools` and
  `TestToolProfileReadOnlyIgnoresGroupCoreBypassForMutatingTool`. Every
  tool this profile advertises is also verified to perform zero durable
  writes, including MCP session bookkeeping — see section 4's
  `readOnlyHint` note above.
- **`migration`** (5 tools): `core` + `migration` —
  `open_project`, `get_project`, `export_project`, `validate_import`,
  `apply_import`. The
  minimal project opening/metadata/export/validate/apply transfer workflow,
  nothing else.

`tools/list` output is lexically ordered by the SDK regardless of profile
or registration order, so it stays deterministic across all four
profiles and any toolset selection.

### 5.3. Disabled tools are absent and uncallable

A tool excluded by the active profile or toolset selection is never
registered with the underlying MCP server at all: it is both absent from
`tools/list` and fails as an unknown tool if a client calls it directly by
name — there is no hidden registration path that leaves it reachable.
Stdio and local HTTP transports are filtered identically, since both are
built from the same server composition and the same active selection
(`internal/adapters/mcp.Options.ToolProfile` / `Options.Toolsets`).

### 5.4. Free-form toolset selection (`--toolsets`)

When none of the four named profiles fits a deployment, `--toolsets`
composes a catalog directly from the section 5.2 capability groups:

```bash
rhizome-mcp serve --toolsets issues,planning
```

```bash
RHIZOME_TOOLSETS=knowledge,sync rhizome-mcp serve
```

The advertised catalog is exactly the named groups plus `core`
(`open_project`, `get_project`), which is always included for the same
reason every named profile includes it: a client must always be able to
route explicitly and diagnose a missing tool. Naming `core` in the list is
valid but redundant. The valid group names are the section 5.2 vocabulary:
`core`, `issues`, `planning`, `review`, `knowledge`, `lifecycle`,
`governance`, `migration`, `sync` (`internal/domain.AllToolsets` — the
same single list registration declares groups from, so the flag's
vocabulary can never drift from the catalog). An unsupported, duplicate,
or empty entry fails startup before any transport opens with a structured
error naming every valid group, exactly like an unrecognized profile name.

A toolset selection differs from the named profiles in two deliberate
ways. It never consults annotation hints — it composes whole groups, so
`read-only` narrowing is available only as the profile. And it has no
governance carve-out: the `agent` profile withholds `governance` so an
agent cannot widen its own gates, but an operator who explicitly names
`governance` in a selection gets the policy administration tools.

`--profile` and `--toolsets` (and their environment variables) are
mutually exclusive. Passing both flags fails argument parsing as a usage
error; a mixed flag/environment combination (for example an inherited
`RHIZOME_TOOL_PROFILE` meeting an explicit `--toolsets`) has no defined
precedence and fails startup before any transport opens with a
`MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE` invalid-argument error. The `--toolsets` flag takes
precedence over `RHIZOME_TOOLSETS`; selecting toolsets from the
environment rather than the flag prints the same stderr notice the
profile does (docs/04 §17.1). `RHIZOME_TOOLSETS` is newer than the
namespacing migration, so it has no deprecated unprefixed fallback.

In toolset mode `get_project` and `open_project` report
`"tool_profile": "custom"` plus a `toolsets` array listing the advertised
groups (always including `core`) in the canonical order above; in profile
mode the `toolsets` field is absent. `custom` is a report-only value —
`--profile custom` is not accepted.

## 6. Project and discovery

### 6.1. `open_project`

Purpose:

Resolve an existing project from an absolute repository root and return its
canonical `project_ref`, metadata, server capabilities, and guide links. This
read-only call does not establish state for later requests.

Input:

```json
{
  "project_root": "/absolute/path/to/repository"
}
```

Output:

The same metadata envelope as `get_project`, including `project_ref`. Retain
that reference and pass it to every later project-scoped tool call.

### 6.2. `get_project`

Purpose:

Return metadata and server capabilities for the project selected by
`project_ref`, or for the configured default when the reference is omitted.

Input:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "include_instructions": false
}
```

Output:

```text
project_ref
project
session
app_version
schema_version
config_version
tool_profile
toolsets        (only when tool_profile is "custom"; section 5.4)
limits
supported_issue_types
supported_statuses
supported_relation_types
supported_priorities
latest_event_id
guides
next_actions
```

The project instructions are returned only when requested. `guides` links the
three workflow resources advertised by the server.

### 6.3. `export_project`

Purpose:

Export the project selected by `project_ref` as the version 1 logical
interchange document.

Input:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "delivery": "artifact"
}
```

Output:

`artifact` is the default delivery. Its structured content is a bounded
acknowledgement containing `format`, `version`, `exported_at`, `byte_count`,
`sha256`, and an opaque `artifact_uri`. The URI names an owner-only file in the
server's managed export directory and is valid only to a server using that same
directory; clients must treat it as a short-lived local capability rather than a
portable file path.

Pass `delivery: "inline"` only when a caller needs the document in the response.
Inline delivery returns the full logical project document, but fails with
`LIMIT_EXCEEDED` when it exceeds 64 KiB. The default artifact file is retained
for at most 24 hours and its digest is verified whenever it is read. The artifact delivery path performs a durable write by creating a file and pruning files older than 24h in the server's managed export directory, so this tool is not part of the `read-only` profile despite its idempotent and non-destructive annotations.

### 6.4. `validate_import`

Purpose:

Validate a version 1 logical project interchange document without mutating storage and return a deterministic dry-run summary.

Input:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "source_uri": "rhizome-export://sha256/<sha256>/<opaque-file>"
}
```

Supply exactly one of `document` or `source_uri`. `document` is for a portable
JSON payload; `source_uri` is for a managed export artifact and rejects foreign
paths, symlinks, traversal, oversized files, and digest mismatches. A source URI
cannot be used by a separately configured server. Use explicit inline export or
an external transfer mechanism when moving a document between installations.

Output:

The structured content is the dry-run summary containing deterministic counts, zero writes, and sorted conflicts. The tool does not duplicate the full document payload in text.

### 6.5. `apply_import`

Purpose:

Apply a validated version 1 logical project interchange document into an empty destination and return a deterministic apply result with created counts, zero conflicts on success, and the latest destination event ID.

Input:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "source_uri": "rhizome-export://sha256/<sha256>/<opaque-file>"
}
```

As with `validate_import`, supply exactly one of `document` or `source_uri`.

`apply_import` restores historical terminal state and is exempt from workflow-gate evaluation (docs/02 §17.1) regardless of any imported issue's status -- but every imported issue still runs the same field/enum/limit validation `create_issue` runs (`CreateIssueInput.Validate`).

Output:

The structured content is the apply result containing deterministic counts, sorted conflicts, and the latest event ID. The tool does not duplicate the full document payload in text.

### 6.6. `list_labels`

Input:

```json
{
  "project_ref": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "query": null,
  "limit": 50,
  "cursor": null
}
```

Output:

```text
items
next_cursor
has_more
```

Deterministic ordering:

```text
normalized_name ASC
```

---

## 7. Issue operations

### 7.1. `create_issue`

Input:

```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "title": "Implement atomic claim",
  "description": null,
  "acceptance_criteria": null,
  "status": "open",
  "priority": "medium",
  "ready_rank": null,
  "parent_issue_id": null,
  "blocked_reason": null,
  "labels": [],
  "create_missing_labels": true,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Rules:

- `type`, `title` are required.
- `status` defaults to `open`.
- `priority` defaults to `medium`.
- `ready_rank` is optional and must be between 0 and 1000000000. It sets the
  new issue's explicit position in the READY queue (docs/02 §3.7): lower sorts
  earlier, and it only affects listing order while the issue is `ready`.
- `blocked_reason` is required when status is `blocked`.
- Parent constraints are validated.
- `idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request replays the original issue response; reusing it with a different request returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
- `status: review` or `status: done` is gated exactly like the matching completion path -- `complete_work_to_review` / `complete_work_to_done` respectively, evaluated from a virtual `open` (docs/02 §17.1). An unmet requirement fails the call with `WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED` (§13) and creates no issue. `status: cancelled` is not gated.

`view` supports exactly `compact` and `full`. It defaults to `compact` when omitted. Explicit `view: "full"` preserves the legacy complete issue response for callers that need the full record.

Compact output (`view: "compact"`, default):

```json
{
  "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "display_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "sequence_no": 42,
  "type": "task",
  "status": "open",
  "priority": "medium",
  "version": 1
}
```

Compact responses omit issue bodies, labels, timestamps, and other non-essential issue metadata. The full response is the legacy complete issue payload.

Migration guidance: callers that previously relied on the full issue record should pass `view: "full"`; callers that only need the compact identifiers and status fields can keep the default.

### 7.2. `update_issue`

Patch semantics:

- absent field: leave unchanged;
- `null`: clear a nullable field;
- empty string: an explicit value if allowed.

Changing `type` away from `epic` fails with `INVALID_EPIC_PARENT` (detail field `type`, code `HAS_CHILDREN`) while the epic still has non-archived children.

On an executable issue (`task` or `bug`), a status patch targeting `review` or `done` fails with `INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION` (detail field `changes.status`, code `UNSUPPORTED_DIRECT_TRANSITION`) regardless of the current stored status. Those two statuses are reachable only through `claim_issue`/`finish_attempt`'s gated enforcement points (docs/02 §17.1), never through a direct patch.

**Closing an epic.** An `epic` is not executable, so it can never be claimed and can never reach `done` through an attempt. A completed epic is therefore closed with an ordinary status patch:

```json
{ "issue_id": "ISSUE-158", "expected_version": 3, "changes": { "status": "done" } }
```

This is permitted from `open` and from `ready`. A direct patch to `review` remains rejected for every issue type, epics included, because `review` means "inspect this attempt's result" and an epic has no attempt to inspect.

An epic sitting in `ready` is meaningless but harmless: `is_claimable` is `false` for non-executable types, so it is never offered as work, and it closes with the same patch. Closing an epic does not check that its children are terminal — an epic may legitimately close with a cancelled or descoped child — so confirm the child set yourself before closing.

A status patch targeting `cancelled` fails with `ACTIVE_ATTEMPT_EXISTS` while the issue has an active work attempt -- the same guard `archive_issue` applies (§7.5) -- so cancelling an issue can never orphan its active attempt's lease or reservations. As with `archive_issue`, an attempt whose lease has already lapsed is swept first, so a truly-expired attempt never blocks the cancellation.

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "expected_version": 7,
  "changes": {
    "title": "Implement atomic issue claim",
    "description": null,
    "acceptance_criteria": null,
    "type": "task",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "ready",
    "ready_rank": 3,
    "parent_issue_id": null,
    "blocked_reason": null,
    "labels": ["database", "concurrency"]
  },
  "create_missing_labels": true,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Only changed fields should be present. `ready_rank` follows the same
absent/null/value semantics as every other nullable patch field: absent
preserves the stored position, `null` clears it, and a value in
`0..1000000000` replaces it (docs/02 §3.7).

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (`issue_id`,
`expected_version`, `changes`, and `create_missing_labels`) replays the original
patch response, including after `expected_version` has since moved on from a
later, unrelated update. Reusing the key with a different normalized request
returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

`view` supports exactly `compact` and `full`. It defaults to `compact` when omitted. Explicit `view: "full"` preserves the legacy complete issue response with the full issue payload plus the changed field list.

Compact output (`view: "compact"`, default):

```json
{
  "issue": {
    "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "display_id": "ISSUE-42",
    "status": "ready",
    "version": 8
  },
  "changed_fields": ["status", "priority", "version"]
}
```

Compact responses omit issue bodies, labels, timestamps, and other non-essential issue metadata. Migration guidance is the same as for create: callers that need the legacy full issue payload should pass `view: "full"`.

### 7.3. `get_issue`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "view": "standard"
}
```

Views:

```text
compact
standard
full
```

Default:

```text
view = standard
```

Output:

```text
issue projection
```

Projection matrix:

```text
compact
- id
- display_id
- sequence_no
- type
- title
- version
- updated_at

standard (default when view is omitted)
- all compact fields
- status
- priority
- ready_rank
- parent_issue_id
- blocked_reason
- created_at
- closed_at
- archived_at
- labels (bounded reference: id, name)
- description and acceptance_criteria are absent even when null

full
- exactly the existing full issue payload
- includes description and acceptance_criteria
- includes full label metadata records
```

`full` is the explicit form for free-text bodies and full label metadata. Compact and standard intentionally omit those fields to keep the response compact and predictable.

### 7.4. `list_issues`

Input filters:

```json
{
  "types": [],
  "statuses": [],
  "effective_statuses": [],
  "priorities": [],
  "labels": [],
  "parent_issue_id": null,
  "is_blocked": null,
  "is_claimable": null,
  "include_archived": false,
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Output:

```text
items
next_cursor
has_more
```

Deterministic ordering:

```text
ready_rank ASC (READY issues with an explicit rank only; NULL ranks sort after)
priority DESC
is_claimable DESC
sequence_no ASC
```

`ready_rank` participates only for issues whose stored status is `ready`
(docs/02 §3.7). An issue with no explicit rank -- and every issue that is not
currently ready -- shares one "unranked" sort key, so a database that has never
set a rank keeps exactly the ordering above with `ready_rank` removed.
`view` accepts exactly two values, `compact` and `full`. `view` defaults to
`compact` (including when the field is omitted entirely). Unknown values
(anything other than `compact` or `full`) are rejected as an unsupported
field with a structured validation error. `full` still honors the same
`limit`/cursor pagination bounds as `compact` — it is not a way to bypass
paging.

**`compact` (default) field set** — identifiers, title, classification,
computed status/claimability fields, and the optimistic-concurrency version.
No free-text issue bodies:

```text
id
display_id
sequence_no
type
title
status
effective_status
priority
ready_rank
is_blocked
is_claimable
unresolved_blocker_count
labels
version
updated_at
```

`version` is included in the compact projection so the natural list-then-
mutate flow needs no extra round-trip: `update_issue` and `archive_issue`
require `expected_version`, and without `version` in list items every
mutation reached from a list would first need a `get_issue` call just to
learn it.

**`full` field set** — the complete issue record plus every computed field,
byte-identical to the pre-1.0 default response shape:

```text
id
display_id
sequence_no
type
title
description
acceptance_criteria
status
priority
ready_rank
parent_issue_id
blocked_reason
version
created_at
updated_at
closed_at
archived_at
labels
effective_status
unresolved_blocker_count
is_blocked
is_claimable
active_attempt_id
```

`full` adds `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, `parent_issue_id`,
`blocked_reason`, `created_at`, `closed_at`, `archived_at`, and
`active_attempt_id` on top of every `compact` field; nothing in `compact` is
ever different from its `full` value, and `full` is never missing a field
`compact` has.

**Migration note.** Before this change, `compact` was the only projection and
it silently returned every field listed above (including full `description`
and `acceptance_criteria` bodies) for every item — a project with a real
backlog could produce a response of tens to hundreds of kilobytes from a
single default `list_issues` call. If an existing client relied on full issue
bodies (or on `parent_issue_id`, `blocked_reason`, `created_at`,
`closed_at`, `archived_at`, or `active_attempt_id`) being present in
`list_issues` items, pass `view: "full"` to get that exact shape back
unchanged; no other input changes are required. Clients that only ever used
the fields now in the `compact` set need no changes at all. (`version` was
originally excluded from `compact` and later added back — see the note
above; its value is identical in both views.)

**Response budget.** A 100-issue `list_issues` call in the default (`compact`)
view stays under **64 KB** of structured-content JSON regardless of how large
each issue's `description`/`acceptance_criteria` bodies are, because those
bodies are never present in the compact projection. This is enforced by an
integration test (`TestIntegrationListIssuesCompactViewStaysWithinByteBudget`
in `integration/list_issues_test.go`) that creates 100 issues with multi-kilobyte
description and acceptance-criteria bodies and asserts the default response
stays within budget; measured response size for that fixture is approximately
48 KB. The equivalent `view: "full"` call over the same 100 issues measures
approximately 596 KB in the same test — illustrating why `full` is opt-in.

### 7.5. `archive_issue`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "expected_version": 9,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Rules:

- active attempts prevent archiving;
- related data remains intact;
- archived issues are hidden by default;
- archiving an epic with non-archived children fails with `INVALID_EPIC_PARENT` (detail field `id`, code `HAS_CHILDREN`).

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (`issue_id`
and `expected_version`) replays the original archive response, including after
the issue has already been archived by that same call. Reusing the key with a
different normalized request returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

`view` supports exactly `compact` and `full`. It defaults to `compact` when omitted. Explicit `view: "full"` preserves the legacy complete issue response for callers that need the full archived issue record.

Compact output (`view: "compact"`, default):

```json
{
  "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "display_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "status": "ready",
  "version": 10
}
```

Compact responses omit issue bodies, labels, timestamps, and other non-essential issue metadata. Migration guidance is the same as for create: callers that need the full issue payload should pass `view: "full"`.

### 7.6. `unarchive_issue`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "expected_version": 9,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Rules:

- a visible issue is not archived and cannot be unarchived again; repeated
  unarchive attempts against an already visible issue fail with
  `ISSUE_NOT_ARCHIVED`;
- the issue's archived state is cleared without deleting history;
- unarchiving restores the issue to its default visible state while preserving
  the prior event history and version semantics.

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (`issue_id`
and `expected_version`) replays the original unarchive response, including after
the issue has already been unarchived by that same call. Reusing the key with a
different normalized request returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

The compact result matches `archive_issue`: it returns the visible issue's
`id`, `display_id`, `status`, and current `version`.

### 7.7. Review requests

Review requests bind review work to an issue version, event position, and
optional artifact set. A review request is claimable while its status is
`open` **and** its frozen target still matches the issue: `claimable` is
reported as `false` for an open request whose target went stale, and claiming
one supersedes it with `STALE_REVIEW_TARGET`. Creating or replacing a request
whose target does not match the issue's current version and event position is
rejected with `STALE_REVIEW_TARGET` and writes nothing. See
[docs/09](09-review-workflow.md) "Staleness and concurrency" for every
enforcement point.

#### `create_review_request`

Opens the first review request for a target. It is the only path from "no
request" to `open` in the [docs/09](09-review-workflow.md) state-transition
table, and the only one available once the previous request is terminal —
`replace_review_request` rejects an `approved`, `changes_requested`,
`blocked`, `cancelled`, or `superseded` predecessor with
`REVIEW_REQUEST_NOT_REPLACEABLE`. Use `replace_review_request` instead when a
live (`open`) request must be superseded in the same transaction.

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "target_issue_version": 10,
  "target_event_id": 1900,
  "artifact_ids": [],
  "purposes": ["implementation", "security"]
}
```

`issue_id`, `target_issue_version`, and `target_event_id` are required.

There is no `supersedes_id`: recording a supersession link without closing the
predecessor was exactly the split `replace_review_request` exists to fix, so
this tool only ever opens an unlinked request.

There is no `idempotency_key` either, and `idempotentHint` is
correspondingly `false` (§4). A repeat whose content matches the target's
still-live request replays that request rather than opening a second one, but
that gate is the live request itself: once it has been cancelled — which
resolves the request without changing the issue — an identical repeat opens a
new one. The guarantee is therefore conditional, which §4 does not accept as
`idempotentHint: true`.

`target_issue_version` and `target_event_id` freeze the same immutable target
`replace_review_request` describes: pass the issue's current version from
`get_issue` and the `latest_event_id` any read tool reports. A target that
already fails the comparison is rejected with `STALE_REVIEW_TARGET` and
writes nothing — a request can never be born stale.

`purposes` is optional and defaults to `["implementation"]`: a unique, sorted
list of 1-10 normalized keys naming what this review covers. The purposes in
effect must cover every purpose an active `review_approval` policy currently
requires for this target, or the call fails with `REVIEW_PURPOSE_REQUIRED`
(detail field `purposes`, one entry per missing purpose) and makes no write.

Output is a single review request record (the shared field list below).

Failure modes, all structured and side-effect-free (zero writes):

- Target does not match the issue's current version and event position →
  `STALE_REVIEW_TARGET`.
- The issue already has an `open` or `claimed` request for a different
  target, or for the same target with different content →
  `REVIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS`. Resolve it first (`cancel_review_request`, or
  finish the review), or supersede it with `replace_review_request`.
- Purposes do not cover an active `review_approval` requirement →
  `REVIEW_PURPOSE_REQUIRED`.

#### `replace_review_request`

Atomically supersedes a predecessor review request and creates its open
successor in one SQLite transaction: no partial state is observable between
"predecessor closed" and "successor created." The predecessor determines the
issue scope, so there is no separate `issue_id` field.

Input:

```json
{
  "predecessor_request_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "predecessor_expected_version": 1,
  "target_issue_version": 10,
  "target_event_id": 1900,
  "artifact_ids": [],
  "purposes": ["implementation", "security"],
  "idempotency_key": "replace-2026-07-24-01"
}
```

`predecessor_request_id`, `predecessor_expected_version`, `target_issue_version`,
`target_event_id`, and `idempotency_key` are required. Unlike every other
review-request tool, `idempotency_key` here is mandatory, not optional: this
operation does not hold the predecessor's attempt lease token, so replaying a
retried call safely (rather than risking a second successor from a client-side
retry) depends on the key.

`purposes` is optional: a unique, sorted list of 1-10 normalized keys (each up
to 128 characters) naming what this review covers. Omit it to inherit the
predecessor's own purposes — the common case for a re-review after changes,
which typically covers the same scope. Supplying it sets the successor's
purposes explicitly instead, replacing rather than extending the
predecessor's list. Either way, the successor's target freezes the
currently-active `review_approval` policy requirements at creation (docs/02
§17.6) and the purposes actually in effect — supplied or inherited — must
cover every one of them, or the call fails with `REVIEW_PURPOSE_REQUIRED`
(detail field `purposes`, one entry per missing purpose) and makes no write.
This is a request-shape check, not one of the four gate enforcement points
(docs/02 §17.1): it exists so an approval against this request can actually
satisfy those policies later, at `approve_review`.

`target_event_id` is an ordinary event-log position: pass the `latest_event_id`
any read tool reports (`get_planning_graph`, `search`, `get_project`,
`get_changes`), which is the unfiltered maximum across the whole log. It is
recorded verbatim and is never compared for equality against a recomputed
maximum. At approval the service instead asks whether the *reviewed issue's own*
work changed after that position — events on other issues do not make this
request stale, and neither do review-sourced events or `attempt_started` rows.
See docs/09 "Staleness and concurrency".

Output:

```text
predecessor
successor
latest_event_id
```

`predecessor` and `successor` are each a full review request record (see the
shared field list below). `successor.supersedes_id` always points back to
`predecessor.id`, and `predecessor.status` is always `superseded`.

Failure modes, all structured and side-effect-free (zero writes):

- Stale `predecessor_expected_version` → `VERSION_CONFLICT` (retryable).
- Predecessor is currently `claimed` → `REVIEW_REQUEST_CLAIMED`. This
  operation does not carry the attempt's lease token, so it cannot detach or
  orphan an active review attempt; the lease holder must `finish_attempt` or
  otherwise interrupt its attempt first, which naturally returns the
  predecessor to `open` for the review requester to try again — or a client
  can resolve the review outcome and create a fresh request instead.
- Predecessor is any other terminal status (`approved`, `changes_requested`,
  `blocked`, `cancelled`, `superseded`) → `REVIEW_REQUEST_NOT_REPLACEABLE`.
- The successor's target already has an unrelated active request →
  `REVIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS`.
- The purposes in effect (supplied or inherited) omit a purpose an active
  `review_approval` policy currently requires for this target →
  `REVIEW_PURPOSE_REQUIRED`.
- Reusing `idempotency_key` with a different normalized request →
  `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. Reusing it with the same request replays the
  original `predecessor`/`successor`/`latest_event_id` without any new
  writes or events.

#### `get_review_request`

Input:

```json
{
  "review_request_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV"
}
```

#### `list_review_requests`

Input:

```json
{
  "status": "open",
  "claimable": true,
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": null
}
```

`status` and `claimable` are optional filters. `claimable` filters on the
derived value (open **and** target still matching), so `status: "open"` with
`claimable: true` excludes open requests whose target has gone stale.
Supported statuses are:

```text
open
claimed
approved
changes_requested
blocked
cancelled
superseded
```

Output:

```text
items
next_cursor
has_more
```

#### `cancel_review_request`

Cancels an open or claimed review request with no successor, a distinct and
legitimate operation.

The operation requires the request ID and its current version:

```json
{
  "review_request_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
  "expected_version": 1
}
```

They apply only to open or claimed review requests and return the updated
review request.

Every review-request tool — including each of `replace_review_request`'s
`predecessor` and `successor` fields — returns a review request with:

```text
id
issue_id
target_issue_version
target_event_id
artifact_ids
purposes
status
supersedes_id
active_attempt_id
claimable
version
created_at
resolved_at
```

`purposes` is the sorted, deduplicated list of purposes the request covers
(1-10 normalized keys; `["implementation"]` unless the request named others).
Only `replace_review_request` ever sets it explicitly — see below.

## 8. Relations and graphs

### 8.1. `manage_issue_relation`

Input:

```json
{
  "action": "add",
  "source_issue_id": "ISSUE-12",
  "target_issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "relation_type": "blocks",
  "idempotency_key": null
}
```

Actions:

```text
add
remove
```

Types:

```text
blocks
related_to
duplicates
```

Rules:

- relation identity is the canonical tuple;
- no relation ID is required for removal;
- cycles in `blocks` are rejected;
- symmetric `related_to` is canonicalized.

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (`action`,
`source_issue_id`, `target_issue_id`, and `relation_type`) replays the original
mutation response. Reusing the key with a different normalized request returns
`IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

Output:

```text
relation
affected_issues
```

`affected_issues` is a bounded acknowledgement projection with exactly these
fields:

```text
id
display_id
version
status
effective_status
unresolved_blocker_count
is_blocked
is_claimable
```

It omits bodies, labels, timestamps, parent/block reason, and active attempt
IDs.

### 8.2. `get_issue_graph`

Input:

```json
{
  "root_issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "depth": 2,
  "direction": "both",
  "relation_types": ["blocks", "related_to"],
  "include_hierarchy": true,
  "include_terminal": true,
  "max_nodes": 100,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Limits:

```text
depth default 2, maximum 5
max_nodes default 100, maximum 500
```

Output:

```text
root_issue_id
nodes
edges
summary
entry_points
truncated
truncation_reason
```

Graph format uses normalized `nodes` and `edges`, not recursive trees.

Epic hierarchy is represented as a derived `contains` edge.

**Response budget.** Each graph node is a bounded projection with exactly these
fields:

```text
id
display_id
sequence_no
type
title
status
effective_status
priority
unresolved_blocker_count
is_blocked
is_claimable
```

Graph nodes omit `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, labels,
`parent_issue_id`, `blocked_reason`, timestamps, and `active_attempt_id`.
The response envelope remains bounded by `max_nodes` (default 100, maximum
500), and the `structuredContent` payload is kept under the 96 KiB MCP cap for
100-node graph results.

### 8.3. `get_planning_graph`

Input:

```json
{
  "root_issue_id": null,
  "depth": 3,
  "max_nodes": 100,
  "include_review": true,
  "include_related": false,
  "include_terminal": true
}
```

Behavior:

- includes epic hierarchy;
- includes blockers;
- excludes archived issues;
- highlights claimable entry points;
- includes active attempt summaries;
- excludes full descriptions;
- **node selection**: when the graph is bounded (planning graph context), non-terminal work (open, ready, in progress, blocked, review) claims the node budget first. Terminal work (done, cancelled) is retained only as relation endpoints of first-pass retained nodes, not as independent budget consumers — and it is still traversed *through*, so work reachable only via a finished parent or blocker stays in the graph. This ensures the planning projection answers "what can I work on" without finished issues consuming room for open work.

Output:

```text
nodes
edges
entry_points
blocking_nodes
summary
warnings
truncated
truncation_reason
```

**Entry points and truncation.** `summary.entry_point_count` is computed over the entire snapshot of claimable issues, not merely over retained `nodes`, so truncation never shrinks how much claimable work the client is told exists. An entry point may therefore name an issue absent from `nodes` — whenever the graph is truncated by the node budget, and equally whenever an issue simply lies outside the traversal's `depth` from any root.

The serialized `entry_points` list is bounded by the same `max_nodes` budget that bounds `nodes`, so the planning graph keeps the shared 100-node / 96 KiB response budget rather than shipping thousands of ULIDs on every call and board poll. The kept prefix is the deterministic snapshot order, so the visible window is stable across calls. When the list is capped, `summary.entry_point_count` exceeds `len(entry_points)` and `truncated` is set — the shrink is explicit, never silent. Raise `max_nodes`, or use `list_issues` with claimability filters, which is the right tool at that scale.

**What `truncated` means.** `truncated` is set only when a *budget* dropped something a larger budget would have kept: the node budget (`truncation_reason: "node_limit"`) or the entry-point cap (`"entry_point_limit"`). It is single-valued and `node_limit` wins when both apply, which in practice it always does — every entry point is a claimable non-terminal node and therefore a traversal root, so a snapshot with more entry points than the budget exhausts the node budget too. A client that sees `node_limit` should still compare `entry_point_count` with `len(entry_points)` to learn whether the list was also capped.

Deterministic selection outcomes are *not* truncation and never set the flag: a terminal issue dropped because the endpoints-only rule attaches it to no retained node, or excluded outright by `include_terminal: false`. No `max_nodes` value changes those, so reporting them would send a client into an unwinnable raise-and-retry loop and leave every project holding one relation-free finished issue permanently marked truncated.

`include_terminal` (optional, default `true`): Include done and cancelled issues in the node selection. Set to `false` to exclude terminal work from the returned nodes entirely, as the board CLI does; this causes only non-terminal work to count against the node budget. Excluded terminal issues are still traversed through, so non-terminal work connected only via finished issues remains in the graph.

**Response budget.** Shares the same bounded node projection and the same
100-node `structuredContent` 96 KiB budget documented in section 8.2 for
`get_issue_graph` — see that section's response budget note.

## 9. Batch planning

### 9.1. `validate_issue_plan`

Dry-run only.

Input:

```json
{
  "issues": [],
  "relations": [],
  "decisions": [],
  "include_normalized_plan": false
}
```

New entities may define local refs:

```json
{
  "ref": "storage-layer",
  "type": "task",
  "title": "Implement storage layer"
}
```

Validation includes:

- enum values;
- field limits;
- parent constraints;
- local refs;
- relation duplicates;
- `blocks` cycles;
- batch limits.

Output:

```text
valid
errors
warnings
summary
plan_fingerprint
normalization_changed
normalized_plan (only when requested)
next_actions
```

`include_normalized_plan` defaults to `false`. The compact default returns
diagnostics, counts, whether normalization changed the submitted plan, and a
stable lowercase SHA-256 fingerprint of the normalized plan's deterministic
JSON encoding. Set `include_normalized_plan: true` when a caller needs the full
normalized plan, including before passing that exact result to
`apply_issue_plan`. The fingerprint is identical for an input and its already
normalized equivalent.

Errors are deterministically sorted by:

```text
entity index
field path
error code
```

### 9.2. `apply_issue_plan`

Input is the validated plan plus:

```json
{
  "idempotency_key": "plan-storage-v1"
}
```

Limits:

```text
50 new issues
100 relations
50 label assignments
20 decisions
```

Behavior:

- performs the same validation again;
- evaluates the create-time workflow gate for every entry whose `status` is `review` or `done`, exactly as `create_issue` would for that status (docs/02 §17.1), before any row is written;
- executes in one transaction;
- rolls back completely on any error, including a gate failure on any single entry;
- assigns issue numbers atomically.

Output:

```text
created_issues by local ref
created_relations
created_decisions
latest_event_id
```

---

## 10. Communication and durable knowledge

### 10.1. `add_comment`

Implemented as append-only issue communication. The issue must exist and must
not be archived. When the MCP connection has a durable session, the created
comment and its `comment_added` event use that session for attribution;
otherwise both attributions are NULL. The operation writes one compact event
payload containing only the comment ID and returns the created comment.

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "content": "The claim transaction must also create the event.",
  "idempotency_key": null
}
```

Output:

```text
comment
```

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (`issue_id`
and `content`) replays the original comment response. Reusing the key with a
different normalized request returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

### 10.2. `record_decision`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "title": "Use renewable leases",
  "summary": "Active attempts use short renewable leases.",
  "content": "Full reasoning in Markdown.",
  "status": "active",
  "supersedes_id": null
}
```

Output:

```text
decision
superseded_decision_id
```

Decisions are append-only records and may be project-level or issue-level.
Supplying `supersedes_id` atomically creates an active replacement and marks
one active predecessor superseded; the predecessor must have the same scope.
The standalone operation writes one compact, session-attributed
`decision_recorded` event.

`record_decision` does not accept `idempotency_key`: the field is not part of
its published input schema. Unlike the other mutations in this catalog,
`supersedes_id` makes one call responsible for two conditional writes (marking
a predecessor superseded and inserting its replacement); replaying that
combination safely would require storing and re-validating the predecessor's
state as part of the cached response, which is disproportionate to the value
for an append-only decision log. Retry `record_decision` by first checking
`list_decisions` for a decision already recorded with the intended content.

### 10.3. `list_decisions`

Lists project-level decisions when `issue_id` is omitted, or decisions scoped
to one issue when it is supplied. Results use deterministic cursor pagination.

### 10.4. `get_issue_activity`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "types": [
    "comments",
    "decisions",
    "reviews",
    "attempts",
    "attempt_notes",
    "events",
    "artifacts"
  ],
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": null,
  "order": "newest_first"
}
```

Output:

```text
items
next_cursor
has_more
```

Every item contains `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `issue_id`, `occurred_at`, and
exactly one matching typed payload among `comment`, `decision`, `review`,
`attempt`, `attempt_note`, `event`, and `artifact`. The envelope owns entity
identity, issue scope, and occurrence time. Typed payloads omit their repeated
entity ID, issue ID, and occurrence timestamp while preserving their other
category-specific fields.

The `types` input is optional; when omitted or empty, all categories are
returned. Supported categories are exactly `comments`, `decisions`, `reviews`,
`attempts`, `attempt_notes`, `events`, and `artifacts`. The default limit is
`20`, the maximum limit is `100`, and only `newest_first` ordering is supported.

Pagination uses an opaque, versioned cursor; invalid cursors fail with
structured invalid-argument errors. The response includes `items`,
`next_cursor`, and `has_more`. Attempts do not expose lease tokens
or lease hashes. Event payloads preserve durable activity metadata. Results are
returned from one consistent read snapshot and are ordered deterministically by
`occurred_at` descending, then a fixed category rank, then source ID. Global or
null-scope decisions and events are excluded from issue activity; full
issue-owned event history, including issue creation, remains included.

**Response budget.** Item count is bounded by `limit` (default `20`, maximum
`100`); this bound is enforced, not just documented. Each item's own
free-text field is bounded at write time, not by activity itself: comment
content up to 50,000 runes (`add_comment`), decision content up to 100,000
runes (`record_decision`), and attempt/attempt-note content up to 50,000
runes each (`finish_attempt` / `save_attempt_note`). A page of `limit` items
that are all near their per-item maximum is a real, if unusual, worst case —
for size-sensitive callers, narrow `types` to the categories you need and
prefer the default `limit` over the maximum.

---

## 11. Agent work lifecycle

### 11.1. `claim_issue`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "lease_seconds": null,
  "resources": null,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "view": "compact"
}
```

`lease_seconds` is bounded by `domain.MinLeaseSeconds`..`domain.MaxLeaseSeconds`
(`60`..`3600`); omitting it or sending `null` uses `domain.DefaultLeaseSeconds`
(`900`, fifteen minutes). The same bounds and default apply to
`renew_attempt`.

Behavior:

- checks claimability;
- evaluates the `claim_work` workflow gate and snapshots the effective
  requirement set onto the new attempt (docs/02 §17); an unmet requirement
  fails the call with `WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED` before any attempt is
  created;
- determines `work` or `review`;
- creates attempt atomically;
- when `resources` is a non-empty array, acquires every listed resource
  (docs/02 §18) in the same transaction as the claim -- a conflict with an
  existing active reservation or a malformed/internally-overlapping
  resources list aborts the whole claim, leaving neither the attempt nor
  any reservation behind (`RESOURCE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT`,
  `INVALID_RESERVATION_SET`). Only work attempts may hold reservations: a
  claim that resolves to `kind: "review"` rejects a non-empty `resources`
  with `VALIDATION_ERROR` rather than silently ignoring it. Omitting
  `resources` (or passing an empty array) is unchanged from before this
  field existed;
- records issue version and event ID;
- creates an opaque lease token;
- accepts an optional `idempotency_key` that, for the same normalized request, either rotates the lease and returns a fresh `lease_token` for the same attempt (if it is still active) or fails with `ATTEMPT_NOT_ACTIVE` (if it has since finished, expired, or been force-released); a different request with the same key returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. The original raw token is never persisted or replayed — only its hash is stored, so a repeated claim always supplies a fresh secret rather than resupplying the first one.

`view` supports exactly `compact` and `full`. It defaults to `compact` when omitted. Explicit `view: "full"` preserves the legacy complete claim response with the full issue projection, the full attempt payload, and the same workflow context fields.

Compact output (`view: "compact"`, default):

```json
{
  "issue": {
    "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "status": "ready",
    "version": 8
  },
  "attempt": {
    "id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
    "kind": "work",
    "lease_expires_at": "2026-08-05T12:34:56Z"
  },
  "reservations": [],
  "lease_token": "opaque-token"
}
```

The `lease_token` field appears only in claim results, including idempotent claim replay responses. Compact claim responses omit issue bodies, labels, timestamps, attempt history, and other non-essential metadata. They also never introduce lease tokens outside claim results. Migration guidance is the same as for the other mutations: callers that need the legacy full claim payload should pass `view: "full"`. `reservations` is present only when `resources` was requested and non-empty; both compact and full claim responses list every newly acquired reservation in section 11.6's compact shape.

### 11.2. `renew_attempt`

Input:

```json
{
  "attempt_id": "01J...",
  "lease_token": "opaque-token",
  "lease_seconds": null
}
```

`lease_seconds` uses the same bounds and default as `claim_issue`: `60`..`3600`
seconds, defaulting to `900`.

Output:

```text
lease_expires_at
server_time
```

No content-heavy audit event is written for every heartbeat.

### 11.3. `save_attempt_note`

Input:

```json
{
  "attempt_id": "01J...",
  "lease_token": "opaque-token",
  "kind": "checkpoint",
  "content": "Repository layer is implemented.",
  "next_steps": [
    "Implement claim transaction",
    "Add concurrency tests"
  ],
  "important": true,
  "artifacts": [],
  "idempotency_key": null
}
```

Kinds:

```text
progress
finding
warning
checkpoint
```

`idempotency_key` is optional. When supplied, it must be a non-blank string up
to 128 runes. Reusing the same key with the same normalized request (the
lease-token proof, `kind`, `content`, `next_steps`, `important`, and
`artifacts`) replays the original note response without creating another note,
event, or artifact set. Reusing the key with a different normalized request
returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

Output:

```text
attempt_note
artifacts
```

### 11.4. `finish_attempt`

Common input:

```text
attempt_id
lease_token
outcome
result_summary
next_steps
verification
artifacts
acknowledged_changes
idempotency_key
```

`idempotency_key` is optional for `finish_attempt`. When supplied, the
normalized request (including the lease-token proof and caller artifact fields,
but excluding the transient MCP session and generated artifact values) is
hashed and stored with the final response in the same SQLite transaction.
Retrying the same key with the same normalized request replays that exact
response, including after reconnect or database reopen, without creating
another event or artifact set. Reusing the key with a different normalized
request returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`; a request without a key retains the
ordinary non-idempotent finish behavior.

Outcomes (all kinds):

```text
completed
failed
interrupted
```

The required and forbidden fields for each (kind, outcome) combination are:

**Work attempt + outcome=completed:**
- `target_issue_status` (required): done | review | ready | blocked
- `review_outcome`, `failure_reason_code`, `interruption_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `blocked_reason` (required if `target_issue_status: blocked`; forbidden otherwise)
- `reason_details` (forbidden except when `target_issue_status: blocked`)

Completing work with `target_issue_status: ready` while the issue is already `ready` succeeds as a no-op — the issue returns to the queue unchanged rather than being rejected as an invalid transition.

**Work attempt + outcome=failed:**
- `failure_reason_code` (required): implementation_error | environment_error | missing_dependency | invalid_requirements | tests_failed | context_lost | timeout | other
- `target_issue_status`, `review_outcome`, `blocked_reason`, `interruption_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `reason_details` (optional; provides context for the failure)

**Work attempt + outcome=interrupted:**
- `interruption_reason_code` (required): handoff | user_request | context_limit | client_shutdown | environment_change | other
- `target_issue_status`, `review_outcome`, `blocked_reason`, `failure_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `reason_details` (optional; provides context for the interruption)

**Review attempt + outcome=completed:**
- `review_outcome` (required): approved | changes_requested | blocked
- `target_issue_status`, `failure_reason_code`, `interruption_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `blocked_reason` (required if `review_outcome: blocked`; forbidden otherwise)
- `reason_details` (forbidden except when `review_outcome: blocked`)

**Review attempt + outcome=failed:**
- `failure_reason_code` (required): implementation_error | environment_error | missing_dependency | invalid_requirements | tests_failed | context_lost | timeout | other
- `target_issue_status`, `review_outcome`, `blocked_reason`, `interruption_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `reason_details` (optional; provides context for the failure)

**Review attempt + outcome=interrupted:**
- `interruption_reason_code` (required): handoff | user_request | context_limit | client_shutdown | environment_change | other
- `target_issue_status`, `review_outcome`, `blocked_reason`, `failure_reason_code` (forbidden)
- `reason_details` (optional; provides context for the interruption)

`view` supports exactly `compact` and `full`. It defaults to `compact` when omitted. Explicit `view: "full"` preserves the legacy complete finish response with the full attempt and issue payloads plus the complete artifact set.

Compact output (`view: "compact"`, default):

```json
{
  "attempt": {
    "id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
    "issue_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "kind": "work",
    "status": "completed",
    "issue_version_at_start": 8
  },
  "issue": {
    "id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "status": "done",
    "version": 9
  },
  "warnings": [],
  "latest_event_id": 1842,
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "01J0XYZ1234567890",
      "type": "file",
      "uri": "file:///tmp/summary.md",
      "title": "Summary"
    }
  ],
  "next_actions": ["Select new work from get_planning_graph."]
}
```

Compact finish responses omit issue bodies, labels, timestamps, unnecessary attempt history/default fields, artifact metadata, and artifact timestamps. They also never introduce lease tokens; only claim results carry that field. Migration guidance is the same as for the other mutations: callers that need the legacy full finish payload should pass `view: "full"`.

Completion checks:

- lease validity;
- issue archive/cancel state;
- blockers;
- issue changes since claim;
- required acknowledgments;
- the workflow gate for the enforcement point the outcome resolves to --
  `complete_work_to_review`, `complete_work_to_done`, or `approve_review`
  (docs/02 §17) -- evaluated against a frozen requirement snapshot, not
  against live policies. `complete_work_to_review` and `complete_work_to_done`
  re-evaluate the completing work attempt's own claim-time snapshot
  (`claim_work`'s, per §11.1). `approve_review` re-evaluates the review
  target's own snapshot instead, frozen when the request was created or
  replaced (§7.6, docs/02 §17.6): the purposes that request covers are the
  evidence, so a request can only approve purposes it was already required
  (and validated, at creation) to cover. `complete_work_to_done` also checks
  `review_approval` requirements, but against a live, issue-scoped lookup of
  granted approvals rather than any snapshot, since a plain work attempt
  completing directly to `done` has no review target of its own. That lookup
  counts an approval only while nothing disqualifying has happened to the
  issue since the event position it was granted against, so both evaluation
  paths apply the same freshness rule (docs/02 §17.5). An unmet
  requirement fails the call with `WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED` and leaves the
  attempt active.

### 11.5. `get_work_context`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "ISSUE-42",
  "include": [],
  "limits": {},
  "desired_resources": []
}
```

`desired_resources` is optional and caller-supplied (same shape as
`claim_issue`'s/`reserve_resources`' `resources`): resources the caller is
*considering* reserving, not resources being acquired. Per the reservations
epic's "reservations do not change issue dependency state" decision, a
conflict can only be diagnosed once a caller supplies a concrete desired
set — there is no issue-level intended-resource state to infer one from. It
drives the default-context conflict count/warning below and, with
`reservation_conflicts` requested, the bounded conflict rows.

Minimal default includes:

```text
issue title and description
acceptance criteria
effective status
unresolved blockers
active decision summaries
review summaries
previous attempt result summary
previous attempt next steps
latest checkpoint
warnings
active_reservation_count
conflict_count
gates
```

`gates` is the compact workflow-gate summary, always present. It reports the
enforcement point it evaluated, whether that point currently passes, how many
requirements applied and how many are satisfied, one entry per unmet
requirement, and one imperative `next_actions` string per unmet entry in the
same order:

```json
{
  "enforcement_point": "complete_work_to_done",
  "snapshot_fingerprint": "9f2c...",
  "requirement_count": 2,
  "satisfied_count": 1,
  "passed": false,
  "unmet": [
    {"policy_id": "01J...", "requirement_key": "impl", "reason": "attempt evidence 'implementation' is missing"}
  ],
  "next_actions": ["submit_gate_evidence for key \"implementation\" on the active attempt"]
}
```

The enforcement point follows the issue's own state rather than a caller
input: an issue with an active attempt is evaluated at
`complete_work_to_done` against that attempt's frozen claim-time snapshot
(and `snapshot_fingerprint` is that snapshot's fingerprint), while an
unclaimed issue is evaluated at `claim_work` against live policies (and
`snapshot_fingerprint` is `null`). Use `evaluate_gates` to evaluate a
different point explicitly.

`unmet[].requirement_key` and `unmet[].reason` are the same values the
`WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED` error carries (§13, docs/02 §17.7), so context
and rejection identify a requirement identically. The summary carries keys,
counts and reasons only -- never policy or evidence bodies; read those with
`get_workflow_policy` when they are actually needed.

A project with no active policies gets `requirement_count: 0`, `passed:
true` and empty `unmet`/`next_actions`: the section reports that nothing is
required, which is different from the section being absent.

`active_reservation_count` is the issue's active attempt's currently held
active reservation count. `conflict_count` is how many `desired_resources`
entries conflict with an active reservation held elsewhere in the project
(0 when `desired_resources` is empty). Both are always populated,
independent of whether `resource_reservations`/`reservation_conflicts` is
requested; when either is greater than zero, `warnings` gains
`ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_HELD` and/or `RESERVATION_CONFLICTS_DETECTED`.

Optional includes:

```text
parent_epic
relations
related_issue_summaries
recent_comments
recent_attempt_notes
decision_content
attempt_history
artifacts
project_instructions
changes_since_previous_attempt
resource_reservations
reservation_conflicts
```

`resource_reservations` returns the issue's own reservations (active and
released, newest first, bounded by its limit) — the compact reservation
shape shared with `list_resource_reservations`. `reservation_conflicts`
returns, for each conflicting `desired_resources` entry, the conflicting
active reservation plus its owning `issue_display_id`/`issue_title`/
`session_label`/`lease_expires_at` — the same bounded, secret-free diagnostic
shape `RESOURCE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` errors use at claim/reserve time, run
here read-only without acquiring anything.

Output:

```text
issue
blockers
decisions
reviews
previous_attempt
checkpoint
active_reservation_count
conflict_count
requested optional sections
warnings
truncated
truncated_sections
next_actions
```

Optional detail enriches existing records rather than creating parallel
copies. When `decision_content` is requested, matching entries in `decisions`
gain `content`, `supersedes_id`, and `created_by_session_id`; no separate
`decision_content` output collection is emitted. When both `parent_epic` and
`related_issue_summaries` are requested, the parent appears only in
`parent_epic`, even if an explicit relation would also select it as a related
issue.

**Response budget.** `get_work_context` is scoped to one issue, so its full
`description`/`acceptance_criteria` bodies (needed to actually work the
issue) are an intentional, expected part of the default response — this is
unlike `list_issues`, where the same fields were being repeated once per
backlog item for no benefit. Every optional list section (`related_issue_summaries`,
`recent_comments`, `recent_attempt_notes`, decision details selected by `decision_content`,
`attempt_history`, `artifacts`, `changes_since_previous_attempt`, `resource_reservations`,
`reservation_conflicts`) is capped at
1–20 items via `limits` (default varies per section; see the audited request
schema), and at most 12 sections can be requested at once
(`MaxWorkContextIncludes`), so optional-section growth is bounded. `blockers`
and `parent_epic` reuse the same per-issue projection as the primary `issue`
field (including full `description`/`acceptance_criteria`), and `blockers` in
particular has no configurable cap — it is bounded only by how many issues
directly block the requested one, which is normally small for a real
dependency graph. `related_issue_summaries` is named "summaries" but, like
`blockers`, currently returns the full per-issue projection rather than a
truncated preview; this is a known imprecision worth tightening in a future
change but is not addressed here, since (unlike the `list_issues` default) it
requires an explicit `include` entry and is capped at 20 items.

### 11.6. `reserve_resources`

Input:

```json
{
  "attempt_id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
  "lease_token": "opaque-token",
  "resources": [
    { "kind": "file", "path": "internal/adapters/sqlite/reservations.go" },
    { "kind": "logical", "namespace": "docs", "name": "rfc-1" }
  ],
  "idempotency_key": null
}
```

Adds `resources` to `attempt_id`'s active reservations, all-or-nothing, in
the same transaction: a conflict with an existing active reservation, or a
malformed/internally-overlapping `resources` list, leaves every
already-held reservation untouched and acquires none of the new ones
(`RESOURCE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT`, `INVALID_RESERVATION_SET`). Requires an
active work attempt's lease token; a review attempt's lease token fails
with `VALIDATION_ERROR` (docs/02 §18, ISSUE-179's locked lifecycle: only
work attempts may hold reservations). `resources` must not be empty. An
`idempotency_key` replays the exact prior response for an identical
normalized request (attempt, lease proof, and resources); a different
request with the same key returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

Output:

```json
{
  "reservations": [
    {
      "id": "01J1RESERVATION000000001",
      "issue_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
      "attempt_id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
      "kind": "file",
      "display_value": "internal/adapters/sqlite/reservations.go",
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2026-08-05T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_actions": ["Continue work; release_resources when the reservation is no longer needed."]
}
```

`reservations` lists only the resources this call newly acquired, not the
attempt's full active set (use `list_resource_reservations` for that). Each
entry is the compact reservation shape (§11.8): it omits the normalized
comparison key and the optimistic-concurrency version counter, both
available only from `get_resource_reservation`'s `view: "full"`.

### 11.7. `release_resources`

Input:

```json
{
  "attempt_id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
  "lease_token": "opaque-token",
  "reservation_ids": [],
  "idempotency_key": null
}
```

Releases the named `reservation_ids`, or -- when `reservation_ids` is
empty -- every active reservation `attempt_id` currently owns. Every named
ID must exist, be active, and be owned by the calling attempt, or the
whole call fails naming the offending ID (`RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND` for an
unknown or not-owned ID, `RESERVATION_NOT_ACTIVE` for one already
released); there is no partial release. Releasing with an empty active set
(nothing to release) succeeds trivially rather than erroring. Released
reservations cannot be reactivated -- a later `reserve_resources` call
creates new rows. Requires an active work attempt's lease token, matching
`reserve_resources`. An `idempotency_key` replays the exact prior response
for an identical normalized request.

Output shape matches `reserve_resources`'s (`reservations`, `next_actions`),
listing exactly the reservations this call released, each with
`release_reason: "explicit"` and its `released_at` timestamp populated.

### 11.8. `list_resource_reservations`

Input:

```json
{
  "issue_id": null,
  "attempt_id": null,
  "kind": null,
  "active": null,
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": null
}
```

Filters by issue, attempt, resource `kind`, and lifecycle state
(`active: true` for active-only, `active: false` for released-only,
omitted for both), combined with AND. Results are ordered
most-recently-created first with opaque cursor pagination (default limit
20, maximum 100), matching `list_decisions`'s convention. Every filter is
optional; an empty request lists every reservation in the project across
every issue and attempt.

Output:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "01J1RESERVATION000000001",
      "issue_id": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
      "attempt_id": "01J0ABCDEF1234567890",
      "kind": "file",
      "display_value": "internal/adapters/sqlite/reservations.go",
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2026-08-05T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null,
  "has_more": false,
  "next_actions": ["Use next_cursor for more results, if present."]
}
```

Items are always the compact reservation shape: `comparison_value` (the
normalized overlap key) and `version` (the optimistic-concurrency counter)
are never included here, even for a released item's `released_at` and
`release_reason` -- both of which are included, since they are ordinary
identity fields, not internals. Use `get_resource_reservation` with
`view: "full"` for a single item's normalized key and version.

### 11.9. `get_resource_reservation`

Input:

```json
{
  "reservation_id": "01J1RESERVATION000000001",
  "view": "compact"
}
```

Gets one reservation, active or released, by id. `view` supports exactly
`compact` and `full`, defaulting to `compact`; `full` additionally
includes `comparison_value` and `version`. `reservation_id` naming no
reservation returns `RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND`.

## 12. Search and synchronization

### 12.1. `search`

Input:

```json
{
  "query": "\"renewable lease\" OR heartbeat",
  "entity_types": [
    "issue",
    "comment",
    "decision",
    "review",
    "attempt_note"
  ],
  "issue_id": null,
  "epic_id": null,
  "statuses": [],
  "labels": [],
  "include_archived": false,
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": null,
  "snippet_length": 300
}
```

Supported entity types are `issue`, `comment`, `decision`, `review`,
`attempt_note`, `workflow_policy`, and `gate_evidence`. A `workflow_policy`
row indexes the policy's declared requirement keys, evidence keys, purposes,
fields, and selector (the locked schema gives policies no free-text name);
it is project-scoped, so its results carry no `issue_id`. A `gate_evidence`
row indexes the evidence key, summary, and details. Reservation rows are
also indexed (docs/02 §18.4) and appear in unfiltered results, but
`reservation` is not accepted as an explicit `entity_types` filter value.

FTS5 syntax supports raw phrases, boolean operators, prefixes, and column
filters. Punctuation-bearing literal terms, including hyphenated terms such as
`multi-project`, must be quoted as FTS5 phrases (for example, `"multi-project"`).

Maximum snippet length: `1000`.

Output:

```text
results:
  entity_type
  entity_id
  issue_id
  title
  snippet
  score
next_cursor
has_more
```

Full source documents are never returned by search.

**Response budget.** `snippet_length` truncation is enforced at the storage
layer (a SQL `substr` over the FTS5 snippet, re-validated against
`MaxSearchSnippetRunes` on the way out), not merely documented. Combined with
the `limit` cap, a `search` response is bounded by at most `limit` (maximum
`100`) results, each with a `title` and a `snippet` of at most
`snippet_length` runes (maximum `1000`, default `300`); the worst case is
therefore on the order of 100 KB, and the default (`limit` `20`,
`snippet_length` `300`) is on the order of 10 KB.

### 12.2. `get_changes`

Input:

```json
{
  "since_event_id": 1842,
  "issue_id": null,
  "event_types": [],
  "limit": 50
}
```

Maximum limit: `200`.

Output:

```text
events
latest_event_id
has_more
next_event_id
```

This tool supports incremental refresh instead of repeatedly reading full state.

All events -- issue lifecycle events and review-lifecycle events alike --
share one ordered, strictly increasing `id` sequence (the `issue_events`
table; docs/04 §7, §15). Review events (`review_requested`,
`review_claimed`, `review_approved`, `review_changes_requested`,
`review_blocked`, `review_cancelled`, `review_superseded`) fully
participate in `get_changes`: a review event created after a cursor is
always delivered, and `latest_event_id` reflects the true maximum across
every event regardless of origin. There is no separate review event
sequence to merge, and no risk of colliding or out-of-order IDs across
event kinds.

Relation writes retain one durable event per endpoint so an `issue_id`-scoped
feed observes every relation that affects that issue. An unfiltered global feed
returns one canonical event for each matching `relation_added` or
`relation_removed` endpoint pair. Consequently, global event IDs are strictly
increasing but may contain gaps where the redundant endpoint copy was hidden.
Clients must advance with `next_event_id` and `has_more`, not by assuming event
IDs are contiguous. Event-type filtering, ordering, pagination, and
`latest_event_id` semantics are otherwise unchanged.

## 13. Error codes

The complete domain error-code catalog, sorted, as defined by the `Code*`
constants in `internal/domain/errors.go`. `TestErrorCodesDocMatchesDomain`
(`internal/domain/errors_doc_test.go`) parses this block and fails if it
drifts from those constants, so add or remove a code here in the same change
that adds or removes the constant.

`INVALID_RESERVATION_SET` identifies a malformed or internally-overlapping
resources list (`claim_issue`, `reserve_resources`) -- two requested
resources in the same call that overlap each other, per docs/02 §18.4.
`RESOURCE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` identifies a requested resource that
overlaps an existing active reservation held by another attempt; it carries
one detail per conflicting resource naming the conflicting reservation,
its owning issue/attempt, and (when available) the owning lease's expiry
and session label -- never a lease token. `RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND` and
`RESERVATION_NOT_ACTIVE` are returned by `release_resources` for a named
`reservation_ids` entry that does not exist, is not owned by the calling
attempt, or is no longer active.

`WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED` is returned by `claim_issue`, `finish_attempt`,
`create_issue` (status `review` or `done`), and `apply_issue_plan` (any
entry with status `review` or `done`) when one or more configured workflow
policy requirements are unmet at the enforcement point being evaluated
(docs/02 §17). Its message is `workflow gate requirements are not
satisfied` and it carries one detail entry per unmet requirement, in the
same `{field, code, message}` detail shape as every other error here:
`field` is the `requirement_key`, `code` is `WORKFLOW_GATE_UNSATISFIED`,
and `message` packs the remaining three dimensions as
`policy_id=<id> enforcement_point=<point>: <reason>`. Only `code` and
`field` are a branching contract; the packed dimensions are diagnostics.
docs/02 §17.7 is the normative statement of this shape.

Internal SQLite errors and stack traces are logged locally and mapped to stable domain errors.
