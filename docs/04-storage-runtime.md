# Storage and runtime

## 1. Database placement

One project uses one SQLite database.

Databases are stored outside repositories:

```text
<application-data>/
  rhizome-mcp/
    projects/
      <project-id>/
        tasks.db
```

The repository contains:

```text
.agent-tracker.json
```

with:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "project_id": "01J..."
}
```

The project root is found by searching upward from the current directory for the default opening path, while project-aware serving can also pin a specific absolute root via `--project-root` or `RHIZOME_PROJECT_ROOT`. Routed opens remain existing-only and do not create or initialize a new project automatically.

## 2. SQLite driver

Preferred baseline:

```text
modernc.org/sqlite
```

Reasons:

- pure Go;
- no CGO requirement;
- easier cross-platform builds;
- suitable for standalone binaries.

The concrete driver version must be pinned.

## 3. Required SQLite configuration

At database initialization:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
```

For every connection:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
PRAGMA trusted_schema = OFF;
```

Important:

- connection-local pragmas must be applied to every connection;
- WAL mode must be verified after setting;
- databases must be stored on a local filesystem;
- network filesystems and actively synchronized folders are unsupported.

## 4. Connection pool

Recommended first-version defaults:

```go
db.SetMaxOpenConns(4)
db.SetMaxIdleConns(4)
db.SetConnMaxLifetime(0)
db.SetConnMaxIdleTime(0)
```

The exact values are internal defaults, not ordinary user configuration.

SQLite allows one writer at a time; write transactions must remain short.

## 5. Transactions

Operations that must be atomic:

- allocate issue number and create issue;
- update issue and append event;
- claim issue and create attempt;
- renew or finish attempt;
- expire attempt;
- add relation with cycle validation;
- supersede a decision;
- apply batch issue plan;
- mutation plus FTS projection update;
- idempotency record plus mutation result;
- evaluate workflow gates and snapshot the effective requirement set, as
  part of claim issue and finish attempt (docs/02 §17).

Use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for operations that are known to write and require early writer acquisition.

`internal/ports.Transactor`/`UnitOfWork` expose this same primitive at the
port level: `RunWrite` (backed by `sqlite.Transactor`, itself a thin wrapper
over `DB.Write`) hands the caller's callback a `UnitOfWork` scoped to one
transaction, exposing the idempotency lookup/store, issue-event append, and
optimistic conditional-update primitives every write repository already
hand-rolls. It exists so an application service can compose operations that
would otherwise live in different repositories' own independent
transactions into one atomic write, not to replace a repository's own
command methods -- a repository method that needs a transaction still calls
`RunWrite` (or `DB.Write` directly) and drives its own domain logic against
those primitives.

Do not perform inside a transaction:

- model calls;
- MCP calls;
- HTTP requests;
- filesystem scans;
- Git commands;
- expensive graph building;
- long serialization.

## 6. Retry policy

Retry complete transactions only for lock contention:

```text
SQLITE_BUSY
SQLITE_LOCKED
```

Suggested bounded backoff:

```text
25 ms
75 ms
200 ms
```

Do not retry domain or constraint failures.

The retry is of the *entire* transaction: on `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED`,
`DB.Write` opens a fresh connection and re-invokes the caller's callback
from scratch, up to the configured retry policy's delay count. A callback
must therefore be idempotent with respect to any Go state it did not
declare inside itself: an accumulator, counter, or other mutable value
captured from the enclosing scope will be double-counted (or otherwise
corrupted) if the first attempt runs partway before hitting contention.
`ExpireAttempts` (internal/adapters/sqlite/attempts.go) is the concrete
example that motivated writing this down -- its expired-attempt counter
used to live in a variable declared outside the callback and accumulate
across retries; it now declares a fresh counter inside the callback on
every invocation and assigns the result only once, at the end.

## 7. Tables

Conceptual table set:

```text
projects
agent_sessions
issues
labels
issue_labels
issue_relations
comments
decisions
work_attempts
attempt_notes
artifacts
issue_events
idempotency_records
schema_migrations
search_index (FTS5 virtual table)
workflow_policies
workflow_policy_requirements
workflow_policy_audit_events
```

Requirement snapshots (docs/02 §17.6) are stored alongside the attempt or
review request they belong to, not as a separate table -- a work attempt
carries its own frozen requirement list, and so does a review request.
Exact column layout for policies, requirements, snapshots, evidence
(ISSUE-171), and review approval records (ISSUE-173) is decided by those
implementation tasks, not by this document.

### 7.1. `issue_events` is the single ordered event log

Every durable event -- issue lifecycle and review lifecycle alike -- is one
row in `issue_events`, sharing its single `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
AUTOINCREMENT` sequence. A `source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'issue' CHECK
(source IN ('issue', 'review'))` column (migration `008_unify_event_log`)
records provenance only; no query branches on it. A review event's
`issue_id` is populated directly from its review request at insert time
(there is no join to derive it), and its `request_id`/`target_id` remain
available in the JSON `payload`, the same place they were always recorded.
`internal/adapters/sqlite`'s `appendReviewEvent` helper is the single
insertion point every review event append site uses; there was previously
a second, independently-sequenced `review_events` table, which is why
`GetChanges`, `context_event_id_at_start`, the review-target staleness
comparison, and the activity feed's events arm could each disagree about
what "the latest event" meant. Any future event-producing feature (workflow
policy audit events, ISSUE-170; reservation events, ISSUE-178) appends
through this same table and helper pattern rather than introducing another
independently-sequenced `AUTOINCREMENT` table.

## 8. Constraints

All ordinary tables should use `STRICT`.

Important constraints:

```text
issues.sequence_no UNIQUE
one active attempt per issue
label name unique case-insensitively
no self relation
canonical uniqueness for relations
foreign keys enabled
enum CHECK constraints
blocked status requires blocked_reason
ready_rank range CHECK (NULL or 0..1000000000)
```

Critical partial unique index:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_one_active_attempt_per_issue
ON work_attempts(issue_id)
WHERE status = 'active';
```

Application validation remains necessary, but the database protects critical invariants.

## 9. Recommended indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_issues_status_priority
ON issues(status, priority);

CREATE INDEX idx_issues_parent
ON issues(parent_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_issues_archived
ON issues(archived_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_comments_issue_created
ON comments(issue_id, created_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_decisions_issue_status
ON decisions(issue_id, status);

CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_issue_started
ON work_attempts(issue_id, started_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_active_lease
ON work_attempts(lease_expires_at)
WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX idx_relations_source
ON issue_relations(source_issue_id, type);

CREATE INDEX idx_relations_target
ON issue_relations(target_issue_id, type);

CREATE INDEX idx_events_issue_id
ON issue_events(issue_id, id);
```

Exact index selection should be verified with real query plans.

## 10. Migrations

Migration files are embedded into the binary.

Required behavior:

- sequential integer versions;
- descriptive names;
- checksums;
- automatic forward migration;
- no automatic downgrade;
- one migration owner at startup;
- post-migration foreign key check.

Migration table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_migrations (
    version     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name        TEXT NOT NULL,
    checksum    TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_at  TEXT NOT NULL
) STRICT;
```

Startup sequence:

1. Resolve project.
2. Open database.
3. Configure connection.
4. Verify WAL.
5. Acquire migration lock.
6. Validate migration checksums.
7. Apply pending migrations.
8. Run `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`.
9. Start services.

Explicit recovery for stale project databases is a separate, projectless CLI path:

```bash
rhizome-mcp projects migrate --project-id 01J...
```

This command opens an already stored project database by canonical ID and runs only supported forward migrations. It never creates a missing database and never hydrates a repository marker; the target is the stored project reference itself. Forward migration is intentionally one-way: once a database is migrated, the application does not offer a downgrade path. A stale `OpenExistingProject` error remains non-mutating and points callers to this exact recovery command. This matters for both backups and projectless recovery: a stale database can be inspected, backed up, or safely repaired by explicit migration without creating a new project or silently mutating the wrong repository root.

## 11. Search

Use SQLite FTS5.

Index these sources:

- issue title;
- issue description;
- comments;
- decision title;
- decision summary;
- decision content;
- attempt note content;
- review status and artifact IDs, under a title denormalized from the
  parent issue's current title (kept in sync by triggers on both tables,
  including a rename of the parent issue).

Do not index by default:

- raw metadata JSON;
- heartbeats;
- every issue event;
- lease tokens;
- internal stack traces.

The FTS index is updated in the same transaction as source changes.

Provide a rebuild operation through CLI/maintenance code.

## 12. WAL and checkpoints

Default:

```sql
PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 1000;
```

Do not checkpoint after every write.

Useful checkpoints:

- before backup;
- during clean shutdown;
- after large migrations;
- through maintenance commands.

Prefer `PASSIVE` during normal operation.

Use `TRUNCATE` only in controlled maintenance scenarios.

## 13. Backup

Do not copy only `tasks.db` while the server is running in WAL mode.

Supported backup mechanisms:

- SQLite online backup API;
- `VACUUM INTO`;
- controlled shutdown and complete file copy.

CLI should expose a safe command such as:

```bash
rhizome-mcp backup --output project-backup.db
```

## 14. Health checks

Minimal health command:

```bash
rhizome-mcp doctor
```

Checks:

```sql
PRAGMA quick_check;
PRAGMA foreign_key_check;
```

Also verify:

- expected schema version;
- WAL mode;
- FTS5 availability;
- write permissions;
- data directory permissions;
- free disk space;
- oversized WAL;
- expired attempts;
- migration consistency;
- one-active-attempt invariant;
- active reservations without a live attempt, and reservation
  release-state consistency (docs/02 §18);
- workflow-gate invariants (docs/02 §17, ISSUE-175): policy selector and
  requirement blobs have the JSON shape the evaluator expects, every
  review target has its frozen gate snapshot, and every gate evidence row
  names the same issue as its owning attempt.

Deep mode:

```bash
rhizome-mcp doctor --full
```

may run:

```sql
PRAGMA integrity_check;
```

## 15. Time handling

All domain time comes from an injected clock:

```go
type Clock interface {
    Now() time.Time
}
```

Production uses a real UTC clock.

Tests use a controllable fake clock.

This is mandatory for deterministic testing of:

- lease expiry;
- heartbeat;
- stale sessions;
- cleanup;
- event timestamps;
- retry timing.

### 15.1. Storage timestamp format

Every `TEXT` timestamp column is written in one fixed-width canonical form:
`2006-01-02T15:04:05.000000000Z` — always UTC, always exactly 9 fractional
digits (30 characters). `internal/adapters/sqlite/timestamps.go`'s
`formatStorageTime`/`parseStorageTime` are the sole source of this format;
every write in `internal/adapters/sqlite` goes through `formatStorageTime`
(or a helper that delegates to it) rather than formatting with
`time.RFC3339Nano` directly.

This matters because SQLite compares `TEXT` with `memcmp`, and this schema's
lease and ordering predicates — `lease_expires_at <= ?`, `lease_expires_at >
?`, `occurred_at`/`created_at` ordering, and keyset pagination cursors —
compare these strings directly in SQL. `time.RFC3339Nano` trims trailing
zero fractional digits, producing variable-width strings (a whole-second
value formats as `...05Z`, a value with a fraction as `...05.5Z` or
`...05.123456789Z`); under `memcmp`, a whole-second value's `Z` terminator
sorts *after* a fractional value's `.`, so `"...05Z" > "...05.1Z"` even
though `05.0` is chronologically earlier. Fixing every value to the same
width removes the ambiguity.

`parseStorageTime` stays lenient on read: it parses via `time.RFC3339Nano`
(which accepts 0 to 9 fractional digits, any width) and separately rejects a
non-UTC offset, so it accepts both the fixed-width form and un-migrated or
externally authored data (older backups, logical-project interchange
imports). Only the write side is fixed-width; the parse side is
permissive by design.

The one deliberate exception is `formatLogicalProjectTimestamp`
(`internal/adapters/sqlite/projects.go`), which renders timestamps for the
logical interchange export document (JSON), not a SQLite column. That
document is never compared via SQL `memcmp`, so it keeps the trimmed
`time.RFC3339Nano` form; widening it would be an interchange
format-version change, not a storage-comparison fix.

Migration `007_fixed_width_timestamps` rewrites every existing `TEXT`
timestamp column (all `NOT NULL` and nullable `_at` columns across the
schema) to the fixed-width form in place, using a `substr`/`instr`-based
SQLite expression rather than a Go-side rewrite — this keeps the migration a
plain, auditable SQL script consistent with every other migration in this
package, and the expression is idempotent (re-applying it to an
already-fixed-width value is a no-op). `schema_migrations.applied_at` is
deliberately left untouched: it is never compared with an inequality
predicate in SQL, so rewriting the migration bookkeeping table's own
historical rows was judged unnecessary risk for zero benefit.

## 16. Lease cleanup

Use both:

- lazy expiry during claim/list/context operations;
- a lightweight background cleanup loop.

Cleanup must:

- find expired active attempts;
- mark them `expired`;
- append an event;
- release the active-attempt uniqueness constraint;
- preserve notes and results.

No issue status rewrite is required.

## 17. Configuration

User-configurable in the first version:

```text
database path override
backup directory
log level
```

Keep internal:

```text
journal mode
foreign keys
trusted schema
busy timeout
durability (synchronous)
pool size
page size
cache size
mmap size
autocheckpoint
```

`busy_timeout(5000)` and `synchronous(NORMAL)` are fixed in the connection
DSN (`internal/adapters/sqlite`); `sqlite.Options` exposes only
`RetryPolicy`. Making either one user-configurable is deferred (docs/06 §1).

### 17.1. Environment variables

`internal/config.Load` is the single place every external environment
input is read; no other package under `internal/` reads the process
environment for these values (enforced by a repo-wide test). Precedence is
always flag (where a flag exists) > namespaced `RHIZOME_*` variable >
deprecated unprefixed legacy variable > built-in default.

```text
RHIZOME_SERVER_NAME    legacy fallback: SERVER_NAME    default: rhizome-mcp
RHIZOME_LOG_LEVEL      legacy fallback: LOG_LEVEL       default: info
RHIZOME_HTTP_ADDRESS   legacy fallback: HTTP_ADDRESS    default: unset (stdio only)
RHIZOME_TOOL_PROFILE   legacy fallback: TOOL_PROFILE    default: full
RHIZOME_TOOLSETS       no legacy fallback (newer than the namespacing migration)   default: unset; mutually exclusive with RHIZOME_TOOL_PROFILE (docs/03 §5.4)
RHIZOME_PROJECT_ROOT   no legacy fallback (already namespaced)
VERSION                overrides the resolved build version; no legacy form
XDG_DATA_HOME          Linux data-root input; platform-standard name, not namespaced
LOCALAPPDATA           Windows data-root input; platform-standard name, not namespaced
```

Using an unprefixed legacy variable (`SERVER_NAME`, `LOG_LEVEL`,
`HTTP_ADDRESS`, `TOOL_PROFILE`) logs one stderr deprecation warning per
variable actually used; it will stop working in a future release. Separately,
`serve` prints its own stderr notice whenever the HTTP transport, the
tool profile, or the toolset selection was selected by an environment
variable rather than an explicit `--http-address` / `--profile` /
`--toolsets` flag (docs/03 §5.1 and §5.4, docs/08),
since those inputs can otherwise silently change what a client sees or
connects to.

## 18. Logging

Use structured local logging.

Log:

- startup and schema version;
- project resolution;
- migration application;
- domain error codes;
- transaction retries;
- lease expiry;
- backup and health operations.

Never log:

- raw lease tokens;
- sensitive environment variables;
- entire large descriptions by default.
