# Rhizome Task Workflow

> **Agent Board boundary note:** This skill describes low-level rhizome runtime
> primitives (claim, attempt, lease, finish, review request). At the Agent Board
> level, the **Orchestrator is the sole owner of task-level lifecycle transitions**
> (READY → IN PROGRESS → DONE / BLOCKED). Developer and Verifier execute work
> and return evidence (PASS / RC / BLOCKED + evidence) to the Orchestrator;
> they never directly advance the board-level state. The primitives below are
> the mechanisms agents use to do their work; the Orchestrator interprets
> their outcomes to drive board-level state.

1. Call `open_project` with the absolute repository root. Retain its `project_ref` and pass it to every later project-scoped tool call.
2. Find claimable work with `get_planning_graph` or `list_issues` using that `project_ref`.
3. Read `get_work_context`, then claim exactly one issue before editing.
4. Renew long leases and save restartable checkpoints with artifacts.
5. Finish every attempt with its truthful outcome, verification, and next steps.

Use:

- [Agent workflow](./references/agent-workflow.md) for the complete select/claim/execute/finish workflow.
- [Issue lifecycle](./references/issue-lifecycle.md) for statuses, blockers, relations, and concurrency.
- [Multi-agent handoff](./references/multi-agent-handoff.md) for interruption, recovery, and review.

These three files are generated from the MCP server guides by `go generate ./internal/adapters/mcp/...` and must not be edited by hand.

The equivalent server guides are linked in the metadata returned by `open_project` and `get_project`.
